Functionality
1.Responsive Design:
The application is designed with a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive across various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. The layout is structured using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure an optimal user experience across devices.

2.Task Management:
Users can add, view, and delete tasks. Tasks can be added through an intuitive input field, displayed in a structured list, and deleted via a dedicated button associated with each task. Task management is facilitated with seamless state updates using Redux for efficient handling of user actions.

3.Weather Data Integration:
The application fetches and displays weather data from a public API for tasks related to outdoor activities. Relevant weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, forecast) are shown dynamically based on the task context, enhancing user engagement with real-time information.

4.Task Prioritization:
Tasks are arranged by priority, allowing users to assign a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to each task. This ensures that important tasks are displayed prominently, enabling users to focus on high-priority activities.

5.User Authentication:
The application includes a user authentication system that requires users to log in with specific credentials. Authentication status is managed with Redux, ensuring tasks are only visible to authenticated users. The system supports login and logout functionality, with session persistence via local storage for a seamless user experience across sessions.
